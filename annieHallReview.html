        Watching Annie Hall today, almost 50 years after its release, is still as engaging, eccentric, and novel as I imagine it was back in 1977 when it gathered 4 Oscars. About that—it really doesn’t feel like your typical Oscar movie. It’s small, quirky, intellectual, and kind of exclusive to a certain upper-class vibe. Nowadays, Oscar-winning movies are mainstream, with simpler form and a Sunday family watch feel. Thanks to it being a low-budget, character- and dialogue-based picture, it feels like a film student or enthusiast’s project—tackling all the issues that currently bother the author, and not what people necessarily want to see.

        Having watched the 90 minutes of Woody Allen’s stream of thoughts only adds to my vision of NYC as a cradle of lefty, hipster, intellectual, academic life (repeating after Alvy's verbosity to his future wife). While in the 70s, Poland under the USSR had us trying to steal as much as possible from the government, there in New York, big-city culture was thriving—something that would only begin to emerge here after half a decade. The topics discussed in the movie, like going to therapy or talking openly about sex with partners, are just now starting to normalize. Of course, film also portrays 'analyst' sessions as something not fully accepted, and shows other insular realities bothering people in new York as much as everywhere else. Just by casting in the romance intelectuals, going for adult collage poetry courses it gave me a opportunity to rethink the postition and and role of such people in society.

        Discussing the movie, I cannot not mention the storytelling structure, which in my opinion is a perfect mirror of Alvy Singer’s character. Chaotic, full of intellectually deep thoughts thrown out with less time than they would actually need to be processed. The breaking of the fourth wall, unconventionally shot dialogues, non-linear story, and cut-in lines all align perfectly with the overall feel of the world Woody tries and succeeds to place us in.

        While watching, I couldn’t resist the thought that Alvy Singer is like a bratty kid in an adult’s body, from a family that never had to worry about anything, yet constantly haunted by existential and philosophical questions. That part really hit home for me—and contrary to disliking him, I actually started to empathize with him. I often feel guilty for having such an easy life, and at the same time not being thankful for it and even kind of miserable throughout it. Among the many very quotable moments and conversations, I think this one matches my inner monologue pretty well and says that I am not the only one:

    </p>
    <p><i>
        "You know, there's two types of people in the world: The horrible and the miserable. That's all. The horrible are the terminal cases, the blind, the crippled. You know, I don't know how they can cope with life. The miserable is everybody else. So you should be thankful that you're miserable."

        There’s really a lot of topics touched on in this film—more than I expected. Death, too, lingers in the background of so many scenes. Whether it’s Alvy’s childhood obsession with the universe expanding, the nervous breakdowns, or just the way he over-intellectualizes everything to the point of paralysis. Mortality, impermanence, and the fear of meaninglessness are always present, even (or especially) when he’s telling jokes, which i think is a really big part of why the dry humor has such a power.

    </p>

        Just now writing this review I realized that to me, the romance between Annie and Alvy was the least interesting theme. Not to say it was poorly written or anything—just that all the other aspects were more interesting, not commonly seen, and thought-provoking.
